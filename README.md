# Shogun
Shogun is a small Python 3 module aimed at generating
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) build files.
It attempts to be as simple as possible and does not offer rule generation by
design. Instead, you are expected to provide your own rule file to be used with
the target list generated by Shogun.

## Example
Building a simple C project. `configure.py`:
```python
import shogun

obj = shogun.Objects("source/*.c", "cc", "o")
exe = shogun.Assembly("$builddir/helloworld", "ccld", obj)

shogun.build(obj, exe)
```

And `build.ninja`:
```ninja
rule cc
    command = $cc $cflags -MMD -MT $out -MF $out.d -c $in -o $out
    description = CC $out
    depfile = $out.d
    deps = gcc

rule ccld
    command = $cc $ldflags $libs $in -o $out
    description = CCLD $out

include targets.ninja

cc = clang
cflags = -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -I$srcdir/include -O2 -pipe
ldflags =

default $builddir/helloworld
```

## Usage
Shogun provides three simple classes to help build dependency trees and
inserting variables into your build files:

```python
Objects(self, pathname, rule, extout, *, recursive = False)
```
This is for adding batches of files such as C object files.  `pathname` and
`recursive` are passed through to `glob.glob()` to generate listings. `rule` is
the Ninja rule to use to build the objects and `extout` is the extension to
substitute for the output file. All objects go to `$builddir`.

```python
Assembly(self, path, rule, *objects, options = {})
```
Used for linking executables and packing libraries. `path` is the output file's
path, `objects` are instances of `Objects` or `Assembly` and `option` are extra
variables to be passed to the rules, such as the libraries to link with.

```python
Variables(self, *, comment = None, **variables)
```
Extra variables to insert into the build.

### Built-in variables
Shogun currently provides two built-in variables that it uses for its own
functionality:

```
$builddir
```
Output directory for the build.

```
$srcdir
```
Location of the source repository. This is immutably set to the location of the
configuration script as it is expected to live at the root of the repo.

### Generating the build files
```python
build(*targets, out = "targets.ninja", builddir = None)
```
`targets` is a list of objects and assemblies to build. `out` is the build file
to be generated, stored in `$srcdir` by default. If `builddir` isn't specified,
it defaults to the current directory if it's not `$srcdir`, or `$srcdir/build`
otherwise.
